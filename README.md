### PRoject Overview

This data analysis project examines emergency room visit data from 2023-2024 using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal was to uncover trends in patient volume, average wait times, satisfaction scores, and department referrals. I used pivot tables, slicers, timelines, and calculated fields to build an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to quickly explore patterns and performance indicators.

To simulate a real world healthcare reporting scenario, I took on the role of a data analyst. My objective was to communicate key insights using clear and effective visuals. This project was completed independently without relying on video tutorials, highlighting my ability to manage and execute an analysis project end-to-end using Excel alone.
